# N-Body Simulation  
*A C++ Project for SNU Computer Programming Course*

This project is a numerical simulation of the **N-body problem**, which models the motion of celestial bodies under mutual gravitational attraction.

## Features

- Simulates gravitational interactions between multiple bodies in 2D space
- Solves the equations of motion using the **Runge-Kutta 4th Order Method (RK4)** for better accuracy
- Real-time visualization using **SFML**

## Requirements

- C++17 or later
- [SFML 3.0.1](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)

## How It works


## Build & Run (macOS)

This project includes a `CMakeLists.txt` file, so you can build and run it on macOS with:

```Bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./bin/NBodySimulator
```
